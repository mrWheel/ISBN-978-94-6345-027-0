It’s not the license we choose, it’s the communities we build

It’s not the license we choose, it’s the communities we build. In open source hardware and software circles a lot of time is devoted to figuring out the best license. For license enthusiasts this is a passionate topic with unlimited debate on mailing lists, for folks shipping open-source hardware, the majority of shipping Open-source hardware still uses Creative Commons-Share-Alike-Attribution to display their intent. Maybe that will change one day as new licenses are written.

We think what really matters in the community we all build, the support we offer to our customers and the code we publish. Our guess is that most of the issues with open-source hardware will not be solved in court or with lawsuits. Creating and celebrating a community of people & companies sharing hardware for the benefit of each other is where the real action is at. Putting a strongly worded text file on a download page makes intentions clear (always a good idea) but in the end – it’s the community of people we’re part of that will be the most benefit when things go incredibly good, or the rare times when someone just wants to be a jerk.
